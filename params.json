{"name":"Christina's Senior portfolio","tagline":"","body":"### ***About Christina Jian***\r\n\r\nMy name is Christina Jian. I am 18 year old. I was born in San Francisco, but I feel that I am an immigrant. Because the two months after I was born; my mom took me back to China, and I grew up in China. My father is an outstanding industrial designer. I admire him, so that I think this is the reason why I like to drawing and painting since I was a little.  When I was 15 year old, my mom asked me to move back to San Francisco, because she wanted me to have a better education. Currently I am a senior in Burton high school, and I am taking the AoME class. \r\n\r\n\r\n### **Resume**\r\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wLU0Wk5BTbVa9RJDc3T-tzY8VEsga_2lds7ss7P02qA/edit?usp=sharing\">Christina's Resume</a>\r\n \r\n### **Gallery Page**\r\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mivrFwLaTPmx9IEEZYC62fVzW70LKqKVIsvOHiKS-_k/edit?usp=sharing \">Christina's Portfolio</a>\r\n \r\n### **Contact Me**\r\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/home?trk=nav_responsive_tab_home\">LinkedIn</a>\r\n \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
