{"name":"Christina's Senior portfolio","tagline":"","body":"### About Christina Jian\r\n\r\nMy name is Christina Jian. I am 18 year old. I was born in San Francisco, but I feel that I am an immigrant. Because the two months after I was born; my mom took me back to China, and I grew up in China. My father is an outstanding industrial designer. I admire him, so that I think this is the reason why I like to drawing and painting since I was a little.  When I was 15 year old, my mom asked me to move back to San Francisco, because she wanted me to have a better education. Currently I am a senior in Burton high school, and I am taking the AoME class. \r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
